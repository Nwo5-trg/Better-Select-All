# Better Select All
select all but better

## How To Use
click the select all button ig like its not that hard

only thing that isnt rly obvious is the togglers

#### right toggler
- **screen center** uses, well, the screen center as the center when selecting
- **selected object(s)** takes the center of all ur selected objects as the center

#### left toggler
- **bypass all** does not check if an object *can* be selected, it just like selects cuz :3c
